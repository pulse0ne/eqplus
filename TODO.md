# TODOs
- [x] Figure out CURRENT_STATE
- [ ] Figure out captureTab
- [x] Maybe have simplified popup with just a capture button, then actual EQ in options page?
- [x] Themes (react-colorful color picker)
- [ ] Allow up to 24 filters
- [ ] Change up display so that we don't have to show all of the filter types/enabled info
- [ ] Change up model to have dynamic filter count
- [ ] Change 'Choose' to just a FancySelect (get rid of icon selection)
- [ ] Popup may also have an EQ display...not sure
- [ ] Pre-configured profiles for using a preset for a particular domain
